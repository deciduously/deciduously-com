# deciduously_com

A `deciduously-com` to stand the test of time, power by [Sunfish](https://github.com/tangramdotdev/sunfish/) and [Pinwheel](https://github.com/tangramdotdev/pinwheel/).

## Usage

```
$ HOST=0.0.0.0 PORT=8080 cargo run --release
```

**TODO**:

- can default `HOST` just be `0`, which expands to `0.0.0.0`?
