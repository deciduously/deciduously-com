{% block content %}<main><p>I just got my 30th consecutive GitHub square!  While it doesn't mean much in the grand scheme of things, sustained motivation is tricky for me.  I'll take my little victory, thanksverymuch.</p>
<p>I hadn't set this as a specific goal, which I think was the trick here.  I tend to fail miserably when trying to do challenges like this up front.  I just had a bunch of stuff to work on last month, I guess.</p>
<p>I've noticed in general you can sorta-kinda get a birds-eye overview of my overall mental health over time by looking at my GitHub squares.  When I'm not doing so great, I stop producing, and vice versa.</p>
<p>2018 went pretty well:</p>

<p>2019, pile o' &quot;meh&quot; with a few punctuation marks:</p>

<p>2018 was better, but none of those blocks ever hit thirty straight days -  I think I maxed out at 27 in July-ish.</p>
<p>My day job got (and stayed) significantly more stressful all at once around early Dec 2018, and it took me a long time to stabilize from that.  Even after April I kept stumbling.  I've also been in school for all of 2019, but I don't think that's been a huge factor in terms of time management.  Even when busy, when I'm my best self I <em>always</em> make time to work with code.  If I'm not making commits, it means I'm letting all my energy pour out to the non-technical rest of my life and have nothing left over for creating.  Perhaps that's not a groundbreaking observation, but I like what it says about this month - I've never managed to streak this long before, and it was a busy month outside of my text editor too.  That's gotta be a good sign!</p>
<p>I like that GitHub makes me look at these streaks and lapses for a whole year.  Getting your square for the day doesn't necessarily mean you did something impressive, it just means you did <em>something</em>.  And in those rougher periods, sometimes that's enough.</p>
