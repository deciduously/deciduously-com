<p>This is what you get when you try <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/deciduously"><code>&quot;deciduously&quot;</code></a> at <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/">Dictionary.com</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>deciduous [ dih-sij-oo-uh s ] / dɪˈsɪdʒ u əs /</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>shedding the leaves annually, as certain trees and shrubs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>falling off or shed at a particular season, stage of growth, etc., as leaves, horns, or teeth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>not permanent; transitory.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That's never been an accident.  There's some of my past I want to carry into my future and some I emphatically don't, and I'm glad my story is always in flux.</p>
<p>I mean, right?  Who's with me?</p>
<p>I've been a little extra-prolific this January.  I don't think I'm alone, though, in feeling arbitrarily empowered by not only a new year, but a new <em>decade</em>.</p>
<p>It doesn't make any sense.  It doesn't actually apply to <em>my life</em> at all.  It's just a month since <code>x</code>, three months until <code>y</code>.  But it is how history partitions time, and we're in a new one now, like it or not.</p>
<p>I've got depression and anxiety problems, but who doesn't?  There's so much to LEARN out there.  It's exciting.  Let's define the decade on our terms, based on what's really important.</p>
<p>Everything is always changing and the mere fact that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">FOSS software</a> exist empowers everyone everywhere.  Let's optimize that empowerment, and learn more about our craft.</p>
