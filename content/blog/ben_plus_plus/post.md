Much to not-too-far-past-Ben's surprise, I accepted an offer this morning for my first full-time software engineering role. Beginning June 1, 2020, pending a successful visa process and a potential global pandemic, I will be working for [Dalia Research](https://daliaresearch.com/) in the role of "Backend Engineer".

A few points of interest:

- It's primarily a Ruby/Rails job. If you take a quick look at my post history, that's...not one of mine. I will have some Ruby to learn. (I told them this.)

- This company is located in Berlin, Germany. It's not a remote gig, and I live in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. To avoid the prohibitive commute, I'm relocating to Berlin. I will have some German to learn. (I told them this.)

- DEV's `work_status` boolean is entirely to blame. Thanks, DEV, very cool!

The point as it pertains to DEV, I guess, is that I'll probably start [writing about Ruby](https://dev.to/deciduously/how-did-you-learn-ruby-5ecp)! I'm already a fan.

Plot twist, right?

I would love any recommendations you may have for high-quality human-language self-learning. While the office speaks English and Berlin has a high concentration of foreigners, I will want to attain at least [ILR 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILR_scale#ILR_Level_2_%E2%80%93_Limited_working_proficiency) - of course not necessarily entirely before I go. Is Rosetta Stone worth the cash? Pimsleur? I've started the Duolingo track but that's really just practice, I need something more substantial as well.
